These directories correspond to FSAs from this image: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225296496/figure/fig1/AS:601651840827424@1520456385929/Three-examples-of-simple-finite-state-automata-and-their-stringsets-Circles-represent.png

The image does not contain a sink-state, which I added to each FSA (state s).
